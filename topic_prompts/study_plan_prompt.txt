Top‑level key "plan" → array of session objects.

Each session object must have **exactly**:
  "date"        : "YYYY‑MM‑DD"
  "start"       : "HH:MM"  (24‑h)
  "end"         : "HH:MM"  (24‑h)
  "focus_topic" : string
  "approach"    : string   (one concise sentence)
  "tasks"       : array of 2‑4 strings

Mini‑example:
{{
  "plan":[{{
    "date":"2025-05-02",
    "start":"17:00",
    "end":"18:00",
    "focus_topic":"Solving linear equations",
    "approach":"Walk through examples aloud with colour‑coded steps.",
    "tasks":[
      "Watch youtu.be/example (5 min)",
      "Solve 4 practice problems",
      "Summarise the steps in your own words"
    ]
  }}]
}}

Formatting rules:
